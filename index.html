<h2>Is The Ken Redefining Subscription Based Journalism In India?

  <p>In today&rsquo;s newsletter, we talk about the biggest ghost in the town - Journalism. Is print media dying in India? And more importantly, how is the Ken, redefining journalism in India?   <br> <br> Post-2015, Jio revolution, and fast forward to 2020, digitization has become the new norm. With 80 crores (800 million) mobile users in India, as news is being consumed in a flash of a second, we wondered how print media is doing in India.  <br> <br> Hence, we connected to a Patna based Hindi daily journalist, Pushya Mitra and tried understanding the unit economics of newspaper publication. It blew our mind. We are hoping, you aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, fasten your seat belt, guys or a sip a bit of water! <br> <br> We usually buy a newspaper for 3 to 4 rupees. The average overall cost to print a newspaper in India is 14 rupees. Mind you, it excludes the distribution cost. &#8377; 1-1.25 goes as hawker&rsquo;s commission. The reader actually pays &#8377; 2 for a 20-24 pages print. (Sad) There&rsquo;s still 12 rupees of the production cost that needs to be recovered (and that&rsquo;s whooping 85%) and mind you we are not counting profit yet.</p>

<p>The unit economics seems terrible. But are the print media companies making a loss? A big no. The rest of the cost comes from advertisements.</p>

<p>A famous Hindi daily in Bihar publishes an average of 3.5 lakh copies per day. Out of the total production cost of 48 lakhs, only 8 lakhs come from readers. The rest, 40 lakhs has to come from advertisements, every single day, to obtain break-even.</p>

<p>Who gives an advertisement in the newspaper was our next question. Shockingly, in less industrialized states like Bihar, 50% of advertisements come from the government. The percentage drops by another 10 to 15 points, in states like Maharashtra, Gujrat.   And here&rsquo;s the red flag! Journalism is dying, isn&rsquo;t a sloganeering. The news to be consumed by the masses is sponsored by the government and industries. And why would they want a bad PR when they can control the strings of the print media?</p>

<p>So, we wondered again, aren&rsquo;t people fed up of reading stale news when they consume news in a brink of a second. Digital, digital and surprisingly, we found that the circulation, readership and the advertisement of newspapers are seeing growth. We keep the reasons for some other day and dig deep into the Ken and now.   It&rsquo;s clear by now that Independent and authentic journalism can only happen when the readers pay for the news they consume. The Ken started in 2016 from Bangalore, delivers sharp, factual detailed stories every weekday (Mon-Fri) to common folks as the retail subscribers. Apart from this, The Ken provides a subscription for the campus, patron, and corporates.</p>

<p>Mind you, Ken stories aren&rsquo;t meant for everyone. Its target audience is a niche segment, people who understand business, economy, startups, and finance.</p>

<p>Ken&rsquo;s revenue model is exciting and is just one - Subscription. No ads, no pop-ups, no events, no selling your data to the third party. The Ken&rsquo;s annual subscription is priced at &#8377; 3245 (including GST). A report by Indian Print Publisher and Ken&rsquo;s 2x rate of growth, we estimate that Ken has around 15,000-20,000 yearly subscribers and generates a revenue of 4 to 5.5 crores annually.   The revenue may seem meager as traditional print media, but in 2018, the Ken turned profitable and it raised high hope that journalism can exist independent and fair. Remember, a sustainable revenue model is the best guarantor of independent journalism.</p>
