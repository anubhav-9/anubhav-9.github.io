            <p>In today&rsquo;s newsletter, we talk about the biggest ghost in the town - Journalism. Is print media
                dying in
                India? And more importantly, how is the Ken, redefining journalism in India? <br> <br> Post-2015, Jio
                revolution, and fast forward to 2020, digitization has become the new norm. With 80 crores (800 million)
                mobile
                users in India, as news is being consumed in a flash of a second, we wondered how print media is doing
                in India.
                <br> <br> Hence, we connected to a Patna based Hindi daily journalist, Pushya Mitra and tried
                understanding the
                unit economics of newspaper publication. It blew our mind. We are hoping, you aren&rsquo;t going
                anywhere,
                fasten your seat belt, guys or a sip a bit of water! <br> <br> We usually buy a newspaper for 3 to 4
                rupees. The
                average overall cost to print a newspaper in India is 14 rupees. Mind you, it excludes the distribution
                cost.
                &#8377; 1-1.25 goes as hawker&rsquo;s commission. The reader actually pays &#8377; 2 for a 20-24 pages
                print.
                (Sad) There&rsquo;s still 12 rupees of the production cost that needs to be recovered (and that&rsquo;s
                whooping
                85%) and mind you we are not counting profit yet.</p>

            <p>The unit economics seems terrible. But are the print media companies making a loss? A big no. The rest of
                the
                cost comes from advertisements.</p>

            <p>A famous Hindi daily in Bihar publishes an average of 3.5 lakh copies per day. Out of the total
                production cost
                of 48 lakhs, only 8 lakhs come from readers. The rest, 40 lakhs has to come from advertisements, every
                single
                day, to obtain break-even.</p>

            <p>Who gives an advertisement in the newspaper was our next question. Shockingly, in less industrialized
                states
                like Bihar, 50% of advertisements come from the government. The percentage drops by another 10 to 15
                points, in
                states like Maharashtra, Gujrat. And here&rsquo;s the red flag! Journalism is dying, isn&rsquo;t a
                sloganeering.
                The news to be consumed by the masses is sponsored by the government and industries. And why would they
                want a
                bad PR when they can control the strings of the print media?</p>

            <p>So, we wondered again, aren&rsquo;t people fed up of reading stale news when they consume news in a brink
                of a
                second. Digital, digital and surprisingly, we found that the circulation, readership and the
                advertisement of
                newspapers are seeing growth. We keep the reasons for some other day and dig deep into the Ken and now.
                It&rsquo;s clear by now that Independent and authentic journalism can only happen when the readers pay
                for the
                news they consume. The Ken started in 2016 from Bangalore, delivers sharp, factual detailed stories
                every
                weekday (Mon-Fri) to common folks as the retail subscribers. Apart from this, The Ken provides a
                subscription
                for the campus, patron, and corporates.</p>

            <p>Mind you, Ken stories aren&rsquo;t meant for everyone. Its target audience is a niche segment, people who
                understand business, economy, startups, and finance.</p>

            <p>Ken&rsquo;s revenue model is exciting and is just one - Subscription. No ads, no pop-ups, no events, no
                selling
                your data to the third party. The Ken&rsquo;s annual subscription is priced at &#8377; 3245 (including
                GST). A
                report by Indian Print Publisher and Ken&rsquo;s 2x rate of growth, we estimate that Ken has around
                15,000-20,000 yearly subscribers and generates a revenue of 4 to 5.5 crores annually. The revenue may
                seem
                meager as traditional print media, but in 2018, the Ken turned profitable and it raised high hope that
                journalism can exist independent and fair. Remember, a sustainable revenue model is the best guarantor
                of
                independent journalism.</p>
